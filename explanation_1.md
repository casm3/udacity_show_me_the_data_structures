# LRU Cache

An ordered dict was used as the main data structure for this problem, the choice was made to optimize the need to check if a given value is already in the dictionary.

All three operations (len, get and set) have constant complexity O(1).

In order to run the tests for this problem you need to run `python3 -m unittest`.
